Approaches:

1. First I tried using cilk_for along with cilk_opadd for the counter variables n_lt, n_gt, n_eq. Though couldn't find a parallel way to fill in the array even using the cilk directives. So abandoned it.

2. Trying to use the prefix scan approach to partition the array. Here my initial array is derived by comapring the elements with a pivot value. PUtting a 1 if the element is less than pivot and 0 otherwise. 
2(a). Then I take a exclusive scan for this array.
2(b).Now for all the element indexes which had 1 in the initial array(those that were small in the pivot), the exclusive scan array has corresponding indexs which partitions them.

TODO:
1. Need to make exclusive scan thread safe, so that I can use cilk_for in it.
2. Need to figure out a better way to keep a track of number of less than elements.
