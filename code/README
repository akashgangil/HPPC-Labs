Final Results: 

There is some speedup but the parallel merge sort doesn't work.
My last working code for all the inputs is the following commit
https://bitbucket.org/akashgangil/lab2/commits/08724ccf7b6c60972e39fc131ad69a1f6afa5542

The above commit just has the normal merge sort with omp directives.


1. After that I tried to implement the parallel merge sort after going through the algo.
2. I mostly didnt thin much and I though I could do away with the output array B.
3. But it wont work, as there would be contention among threads in this case.

The current code runs in an infinite loop, and I am not able to debug it why is that the
case. I have already spent more time than I should on this.

pmerge is the parallel merge routine
smerge is the serial merge routine
